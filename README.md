# esx_bailbonds 1.0

Ok guys here is another one for you. this is a bounty hunter script aka bail bonds.

This is a full rework of esx_policejob https://github.com/ESX-Org/esx_policejob so respect to him

Ok so what is this? well as this is a rework and recode of esx_policejob you have everything they (see the photos).

I have moved all blips and added in new ranks a new garage and helicopter spawn point and garage ( you will need to add your own cars and helis)

Also you will need to workout your own unifrom as i left this out as i have no idea how your server will want it so i have made it where you guys do this

This has been fully tested BUT my server if diffrent to yours so you may have errors, if you do please message me and i will help where i can

Ok so one thing this script does NOT do is how you decided to add it, please dont comment anything about RPing it. please get your players and devs to do this.

Things you and/or your devs need to do to get this working 

1. add the SQL file to your DB
2.add your cars in the DB
3.you need to add the following fine names, cars, helis and uniform as i have left this to you guys as well.
4.RESTART YOUR SERVER. This will not work without a restart as the esx core functions need to read this file on a fresh start up.

I am going to make a custom map for this but the new GTA V update broke script hook so my map editer wont work (i will get it out ASAP)

Please let me know if you need any help or cant get this working and i will get to you when i can.

ADMIN. the discord link and server name are not a working server or a live discord, i forgot the watermark was there as i am using my old server files to make all this.

I hope you like this and let me know what you want to be made next.
